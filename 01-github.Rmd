# Version Control & GitHub {#github}

You don't have to be familiar with version control, Git and GitHub to make use of these notes or the contents of the [scc-pi](https://github.com/scc-pi) repositories. If you're new to scripting and R, visualisations or using R Markdown are better starting points than version control.

These notes are public, but to contribute i.e. [edit them](https://github.com/scc-pi/notes), you need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) and to be granted permission by an owner of [scc-pi](https://github.com/scc-pi) (try Laurie first, but Giles and Anne could help too). Then you can edit directly in GitHub via your browser.

You also need a GitHub account and permission to access one of our private repositories, but not for our public repositories, to download a file, copy & paste code, or source and use a function:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load functions for Sheffield areas from a public scc-pi repository 
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scc-pi/functions/main/ShefAreas.R")

# Call one of our Sheffield area functions that returns LSOA codes 
shef_lsoa_codes() %>% 
  head(5) %>% #only display the first 5 records
  knitr::kable() #display them in a nice table 
```

Try raising an [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) if you spot a problem, have a suggestion or a question.

## Why version control?

When scripting I take a backup of a file, so if the changes I make break what I've previously done, I can revert to the previous version. If I'm collating contributions to a document from different people I might use their initials to indicate who's made contributions in what version e.g. "BI_Principles-GR.docx" and "BI_Principles-NM.docx". These are both examples of manual version control.

When we talk about version control and scripting we typically mean a version control system. A tool that assists with tracking changes to files over time and by different people. Such systems also usually include reasons for the changes, and file, or rather version, comparison functionality. So a version control system is a backup/audit trail/collaboration thing.

## GIT

Git is an open-source distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

## GitHub

GitHub is a product that offers Git-based source control repositories. Other products also offer Git-based repositories, such as GitLab, BitBucket, and Azure DevOps.

Our [scc-pi](https://github.com/scc-pi) GitHub organisation is a free account. It has had no approval as such. If using it proves successful we will need to discuss approval with BCIS.

### Security & data protection

Assuming that GitHub.com is hosted in the US, it will not meet our data protection obligations. Either way, we've not checked compliance with Information Governance, so storing PID (Person Identifiable Data), or anything commercially confidential or politically sensitive, on GitHub.com is currently a no no. As an additional precaution, any projects related to such information should be held in a private repository.

Microsoft own GitHub and [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/github.githubenterprise?tab=overview) is the on-premises deployment of GitHub.com that could be hosted on our own Azure environment.

### Forking and pull requests

GitHub [forking](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and pull requests are common workflows when collaborating on a repository.

*TODO*\
- hopefully we'll have more to add on this if we get to collaborating on a repository

### Other features

GitHub now allows private repositories on [free organisation accounts](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/types-of-github-accounts#organization-accounts), but not all GitHub features are available.

The evolution of a repository is captured by commits i.e. the changes to files in the repository. However, the original issue, ideas or discussion surrounding a commit is captured in a GitHub [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). You can link a commit to an issue by including the issue number prefixed by \# in the commit message.

I've used a GitHub [project](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards) to organise the our private [C19Surveillance](https://github.com/scc-pi/C19Surveillance) repository as a kanban board. However, a project is not restricted to issues or a single repository.

GitHub [pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [actions](https://github.com/features/actions) have been used to [publish these notes](#publishing).

There are also other GitHub features to explore.

## Git & RStudio

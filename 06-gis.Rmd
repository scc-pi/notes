## Portal Login

It's not good practice to include login details in code, so for my
Portal login I'm going to use the `.Renviron` file option for [securing
credentials](https://db.rstudio.com/best-practices/managing-credentials/).

```{r portal-credentials}
portal_id = Sys.getenv("portal_id")
portal_pwd = Sys.getenv("portal_pwd")

```

Then, within a Python code chunk, we're going to [login to our
Portal](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/working-with-different-authentication-schemes/).

## Features

The term "feature" is useful to distinguish a record as "spatial". By "spatial" we mean it has a point, a line or a polygon. A point is a pair of coordinates, a line a minimum of two pairs of coordinates and polygons.

Something to keep an eye out for is MULTIPOINT, multi-part polygons etc. This is a single record, a single feature, but it has more than one point, line or polygon. For example, Sheffield secondary school features might be MULTIPOINT so that the feature for King Edward VII school can have one point for the Lower School near Crosspool, and another point for the Upper School in Broomhill.

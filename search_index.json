[["index.html", "Notes Chapter 1 Welcome", " Notes Laurie Platt 2021-02-20 Chapter 1 Welcome This is a place for ad-hoc notes, mainly to do with scripting and mainly R scripts. It is somewhere to store lessons learnt, a resource to remind yourself if you return to something after a while, or to smooth your path a little if it’s something new. There are many excellent online resources that this will point to and not attempt to replace. Overtime some notes may mature into package vignettes or become accepted as procedure and included in the Methods Manual. Other notes may prove to be of little value. Hopefully others from the Performance &amp; Intelligence Team or elsewhere in Sheffield City Council will contribute to the notes. However, currently the contributions are from a single person and is orientated to one persons experience. This is ETL and spatial analysis, and lacks notes about modelling and visualisations. As well as the contributors and content, the purpose and scope is open to change. I hope you find this useful.

A GitHub Action has been configured to start when there’s a push to the master branch. The Action renders the Rmd files in the master branch to HTML and then deploys the HTML files as a static website to a branch called gh-pages. Alternatives to using GitHub Actions include Travis and Jekyll. I used the steps outlined in the following blog post: https://medium.com/@delucmat/how-to-publish-bookdown-projects-with-github-actions-on-github-pages-6e6aecc7331e However, I did a lot of the git bash commands manually and there were two fixes I had to make to the deploy_bookdown.yaml file: 1. Under … uses: Cecilapp/GitHub-Pages-deploy@master … added … with: build_dir: _book/ email: ${{ secrets.EMAIL }} 2. Used GITHUB_TOKEN rather than GH_PAT, as this is what is now used by GitHub-Pages-deploy. 3.4 Further Resources Authoring Books with R Markdown by Yihui Xie is the definitive resource for bookdown.

# R & RStudio {#r}

## Why script?

I initially started scripting in Python to automate some spatial analysis tasks, but soon realised that reproducibility was the main advantage. Iterating, improving a process incrementally and at the end verifying the results by re-running the script. 

There's an element of self-documentation with scripting, so it's easier to return after a bit of time to a scripted task, or pick up a scripted task from a colleague. However, in-line comments and adherence to a style guide make a big difference to just how easy it is. Version control and collaboration are also easier with scripting than GUI tools.

Scripting is not always better than using GUI tools. It's horses for courses, and some GUI workflow tools (e.g. FME, Simul8 and ModelBuilder in ArcGIS) sit somewhere in the middle.

## Style guide

Something I need to pay more attention to is following the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/), which benefits from supporting tools and familiarity via tidyverse package documentation.

Scripting to the same style guide makes collaboration easier. Which style guide is less important than collaborators scripting to the same style guide.

## Why Script?

I initially started scripting in Python to automate some spatial analysis tasks, but soon realised that reproducibility was it's main advantage. Iterating, improving a process incrementally and verifying  results by rerunning the script. 

There's an element of self-documentation with scripting and with that an ability to return more easily to a scripted task or pick up a scripted task from a colleague. However this depends a lot on in-line comments and adherence to a style guide. Version control and collaboration are also easier with scripting than GUI tools.

Scripting is not always better than using GUI tools. It's horses for courses, and some GUI workflow tools (e.g. FME, ModelBuilder in ArcGIS and Simul8) sit somewhere in the middle.

## Styleguide

Something I need to pay more attention to is following the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/), which benefits from familiarity via tidyverse package documentation and supporting tools.

Scripting to the same style guide makes it a lot easier to collaborate, which style guide is less important than consistently scripting to a single style guide.

## ArcGIS

We're going to make use of the Council's ArcGIS software from ESRI and
Council spatial data held on our Portal. ArcGIS has a better integration
with Python than R, so we're going to leverage that via the
[reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) R package.

It's worth highlighting that ESRI's Python integration with ArcGIS is
via two main packages. The `arcgis` package is what we're going to use
here to work with the Council's web GIS infrastructure. The `arcpy`
package would be used to leverage the ArcGIS desktop functionality. The
distinction between web and desktop for `arcgis` and `arcpy` packages
respectively is an oversimplification, but it serves a purpose. It's
also worth noting that the integration between the two packages isn't as
seamless as you might expect.

To use the `arcpy` or `arcgis` packages we first need to specify the
[ArcGIS Python
environment](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/install-and-set-up/)

```{python}
print("test")
```

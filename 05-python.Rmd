## ArcGIS

The Council's ArcGIS software from ESRI has a much stronger integration with Python than R.

ESRI's Python integration with ArcGIS is via two main packages. The `arcgis` package is what we're going to use here to work with the Council's web based GIS infrastructure. The `arcpy` package would be used to leverage the ArcGIS desktop functionality. The distinction between web and desktop for `arcgis` and `arcpy` packages respectively is an oversimplification, but it serves a purpose. It's worth noting that the integration between the two packages isn't as seamless as you might expect.

To use the `arcpy` or `arcgis` packages we first need to specify the [ArcGIS Python environment](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/install-and-set-up/)

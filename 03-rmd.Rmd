# R Markdown {#rmd}

## R Markdown vs Markdown

*TODO*

## Child markdown iteration

*TODO*

\- example based on C19 UoS example - not a prominent technique because the demand for such reports has largely been superseded by browser base dashboards such as those provided via Power BI or Shiny

## Notebooks

*TODO*

\- technical vs data exploration - don't add to github

## Bookdown

These notes are written using the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) package , which was built on top of R Markdown and [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/).

Each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.

### Publishing {#publishing}

These notes are published on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). A GitHub Action has been configured to start when there's a push to the [master branch](https://github.com/scc-pi/notes). The Action renders the Rmd files in the master branch to HTML and then deploys the HTML files as a static website to a branch called `gh-pages`. Alternatives to using GitHub Actions include Travis and Jekyll.

I used the steps outlined in the following blog post: [How to publish bookdown projects with GitHub Actions on GitHub Pages](https://medium.com/@delucmat/how-to-publish-bookdown-projects-with-github-actions-on-github-pages-6e6aecc7331e). However, I did a lot of the git bash commands manually and there were a couple of fixes I made to the `deploy_bookdown.yaml` file:

1\. Under ...

``` {.yaml}
uses: Cecilapp/GitHub-Pages-deploy@master
```

... I added ...

``` {.yaml}
with:       
  build_dir: _book/       
  email: ${{ secrets.EMAIL }}
```

2\. I used `GITHUB_TOKEN` rather than `GH_PAT`, as per a recent change to [GitHub-Pages-deploy](https://github.com/Cecilapp/GitHub-Pages-deploy#news).

## R Markdown tips

### Markdown visual editor
The RStudio v1.4 release includes a visual editor for markdown, which makes it more like using MS Word:

### Chunk named setup

Naming a code block `setup` means that after you restart RStudio and execute any code in the middle of your markdown document, the `setup` block will run first. For example, to make sure your libraries are loaded first:

```{r, include=FALSE}
# This will allow the chunk header below to be displayed in the output  
knitr::knit_hooks$set(wrapper = function(before, options) {
  # the original chunk might be indented
  if (is.null(indent <- options$indent)) indent <- ''
  
  # hide the wrapper=TRUE option
  opts <- gsub(', wrapper=TRUE', '', options$params.src)
  
  if (before) {
    # add the header
    sprintf('\n\n%s````\n```{r,%s}\n````', indent, opts)
  } else {
    # add the footer
    sprintf('\n%s````\n```\n````\n', indent)
  }
})
```

```{r, setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, wrapper=TRUE}
# Packages
library(tidyverse)
```
